                        <p>
                            After the Second World War, the interest in Magic throughout the country took hold again and Magical Societies began to
                            spring up with great regularity and Wolverhampton was no exception. Whilst there were neighbouring clubs - the British
                            Magical Society in Birmingham and the Staffordshire Magical Society in Wednesbury - a group of magicians led by Donald
                            Crombie, local Wolverhampton solicitor and Past President of the BMS and the IBM, first met on 19th November 1947 and
                            founded the Wolverhampton Circle of Magicians. Jasper Maskelyne accepted the honorary position of Vice President. In the
                            first year the subscription and joining fee were both half a guinea (52.5p!) which probably accounts for the fact that the
                            Circle's funds ten years on in 1957 still only amounted to Â£11 12s 1d !

                            During its 60 plus years, the WCM has been proud to have as members many notable magicians, both amateur and professional.
                            Len Belcher joined the Circle in February 1948, Tony Shelley, Past International President of the IBM, in 1955, and past
                            member Geoff Ray have also held the highest office in the IBM British Ring.

                            The performing standard of the Members has also been outstanding with many winning national awards for their skill and
                            entertaining performances including many International, IBM, Blackpool and Major Competition winners: Jimmy Carlo, Geoff
